# Applied-Research-Applications

Young software engineers and developers can use a detailed history of the evolution of software development technologies to fill the gap of understanding how these tools came to be. Along with a performance investigation between two modern rival frameworks in order for computer science students to make up their own minds on what kind of technologies they wish to adopt in their software creation journey. Testing and comparing these frameworks will be achieved by building two different applications with different tools, these apps scale based on their link in order to test how much workload based on a URL a server can handle. The comparison will cover the difference of performance via server-side rendering measures and the number of requests per second achieved with different parallel connections on each of these frameworks. The aim is point out which technology is over all better performant, and to offer all the necessary information needed for newly graduated software engineers to gather as much knowledge as possible for their choice making process when it comes to tools of software development and programing language.
